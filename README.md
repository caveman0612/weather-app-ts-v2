# Weather App

## Overview

This Website fetches data from the open weather map API. I wanted to make this webite dynmaic so I implemented search functionality, so the use can search by zip code, city, or latitude and longitude.

## Use

The zip and city are pretty self explanatory, but the lat/lon might not be. For the latidude you would use a negitive symbol for W and for longitude you would use the negitive symbol for the S

example:

lat: 47.60 S === -47.60

lon: 122.33 W === -122.33

## install

- Fork this Repository
- Clone Forked Repository
- Create .env file
- get API key from Open Weather Map
- npm start to run

## Technologies

TypeScript, React, HTML5, Bootstrap, Git/Github, Vercel

## Going Forward

I would like to keep working on the README as well as do some checking on the inputs from the user.
