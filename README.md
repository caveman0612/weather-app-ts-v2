# Weather App

## Overview

This project allows people to create lists and cards on those list. I am implementing drag and drop functionalitiy so the cards and folders can move around like in trello.

## Technologies

This project is built on React with javascript. I have intergrated bootstrap as a css library. I have also add Rreact beautiful drag and drop to allow the cards and folders to be moved dynamically.

## Going Forward

I would like to convert this project to Typescript as well as add a backend with a basic database to make this a full stack project.
